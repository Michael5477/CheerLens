            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>How does CheerLens work?</h3>
            <p>CheerLens uses your device's camera and Google ML Kit Face Detection to analyze your facial expressions in real-time. All processing happens locally on your device—your data never leaves your phone.</p>

            <h3>Do I need an internet connection?</h3>
            <p>No! CheerLens works completely offline. The only time you need internet is for downloading the app and managing subscriptions through the App Store.</p>

            <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely! All facial analysis is processed locally on your device. We don't collect, store, or transmit any of your data. Your privacy is our top priority.</p>

            <h3>What's included in the free trial?</h3>

            <h2>Tips for Best Results</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Good Lighting:</strong> Ensure you're in a well-lit area so the camera can clearly see your face</li>
                <li><strong>Face the Camera:</strong> Position yourself so your face is clearly visible in the camera view</li>
                <li><strong>Practice Regularly:</strong> Consistent practice will help you improve your smile confidence</li>
                <li><strong>Be Natural:</strong> Try to smile naturally—forced smiles are less effective</li>
