            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 2024</p>

            <h2>Your Privacy is Our Priority</h2>
            <p>CheerLens is designed with privacy at its core. We believe your personal data should remain yours, and we've built our app to ensure maximum privacy and security.</p>

            <h2>Local Processing Only</h2>
            <p>All facial expression analysis in CheerLens is processed <strong>locally on your device</strong> using Google ML Kit Face Detection technology. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your facial data never leaves your device</li>
                <li>No images or video are stored</li>
                <li>No data is transmitted to any server</li>
                <li>No internet connection is required for core functionality</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Data We Don't Collect</h2>
            <p>CheerLens does NOT collect, store, or transmit:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Facial images or video recordings</li>
                <li>Personal identification information</li>
                <li>Usage analytics or tracking data</li>
                <li>Location information</li>
                <li>Contact information (unless you voluntarily contact support)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Camera Usage</h2>
            <p>CheerLens requires camera access to analyze your facial expressions in real-time. The camera is used solely for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Real-time facial expression detection</li>
                <li>Calculating smile confidence scores</li>
                <li>Providing practice feedback</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All processing happens instantly and locally. No camera footage is recorded or stored.</p>

            <h2>Photo Library Access</h2>
            <p>If you choose to send feedback through the app, you may optionally attach a screenshot. Photo library access is only used for this purpose and is completely optional.</p>

            <h2>Subscription Information</h2>
            <p>Subscription purchases are processed through Apple's App Store. We do not have access to your payment information. Apple handles all payment processing securely.</p>

            <h2>No Account Required</h2>
            <p>CheerLens does not require you to create an account. All app data is stored locally on your device using standard iOS storage mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>CheerLens uses the following third-party services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google ML Kit Face Detection:</strong> Used for local facial expression analysis. All processing happens on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> Used for subscription management and payment processing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Neither of these services receives your facial data or personal information.</p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>Since all processing happens locally on your device, your data is secured by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>iOS device encryption</li>
                <li>Local processing (no network transmission)</li>
