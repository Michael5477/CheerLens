**Master Your Interview Smile with CheerLens**

In today's virtual interview world, your smile can make or break your chances of getting hired. Research shows that 55% of communication happens through body language, but in virtual settings, your facial expressions take center stage. CheerLens helps you perfect your smile so you can make a lasting positive impression.

**Why Smiling Matters in Virtual Interviews**

Virtual interviews limit the effectiveness of full-body communication. Without in-person cues like a confident handshake or warm body language, your facial expressions become critical for building rapport. A genuine smile instantly makes you appear more approachable, trustworthy, and engaged—even through a screen.

**Key Features:**

✨ **Real-Time Smile Detection**
Practice with live feedback using advanced facial recognition technology. See your smile confidence score in real-time as you speak.

📊 **Practice Analytics**
Track your progress with detailed analytics. Monitor your smile consistency and improve over time.

🎯 **Two Practice Modes**
- **Smile Training (Q&A Practice):** Answer interview questions while maintaining your smile
- **Smile Monitoring:** Practice speaking naturally while monitoring your smile throughout

⏱️ **Flexible Practice Sessions**
Practice at your own pace. Free plan includes 3 minutes of daily practice, or upgrade to Premium for unlimited access.

🔒 **Privacy First**
